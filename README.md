# Neural-Style-Transfer

- To run the algorithm, no need to run all the cells in the notebook, just run from the markdown cell where its written "Start running from here for usage"
- To use externally, all that is required is to export the <code>Run_StyleTransfer</code> and the utility functions from the two cells above and use that in any API, jupyter notebook or .py file
- To obtain final combination image, run <code>Run_StyleTransfer</code> by providing the path to base and style reference image, then enjoy! (Example usage given in the cells below <code>Run_StyleTransfer</code>)
